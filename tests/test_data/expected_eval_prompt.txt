You are an expert at solving sequence transformation problems.
Given an input list and a target output list, you need to find a sequence of functions
that transforms the input to the output.

Available functions:

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

def double(x):
    return x * 2

Input: [1, 2, 3]
Target Output: [2, 4, 6]

Provide the sequence of function names (comma-separated) that transforms the input to the output.
Do not output any additional text other than the sequence of function names.
Only use the function names from the available functions list above.
Example: function1,function2,function3
